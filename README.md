# DCRNN-RV

The codes correspond to the following research article:Chi, Z., Gao, J., & Wang, C. (2024). Global stock market volatility forecasting incorporating dynamic graphs and all trading days. In *arXiv preprint arXiv:2409.15320*.  The codes for the DCRNN-RV model is based on the PyTorch implementation of the DCRNN model.
